This is a very famous project and almost every Data-Scientist LinkedIn profile have this project. So in this project i have taken some biological parameter into account which are the most helpful for detecting the breast cancer. We get to know this by doing some SCAN,test,etc. in hospital but in Machine Learning Model, this can be predicted once we have some biological data and it will give you an accuracy of over 95%( precisely 95.62%).At last, we will also compute the accuracy with K-Fold Cross Validation which improves an accuracy to 96.70%. So in this way, Machine Learning can be used in Medical Science too! At last, we will improve the accuracy for our model to 97.81% by the technique called "XGBoost".
