Let me give you a real life scenario where Classification Model can be applied. Suppose you want to buy a car and went to a Car showroom.Now whenever you go to the showroom, they always tell you to fill some kind of form( having fields like Age,Estimated Salary,Email Id, Phone No., etc.) irrelevant of whether you buy a car or not. Now, that data goes to Data-Scientist of Car company where he/she used "Logistic Regression" , "K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)" , "Support Vector Machine(SVM)" , "Kernel SVM" , "Naive Bayes" , "Decision Tree Classification" , "Random Forest Classification" models(and will choose the one in which he/she gets the maximum accuracy on test set) to predict which kind of customer will be more likely to buy new model of that car.So, data scientist will give that result and that result will go to the advertisement team where advertisement team will target that customer which will be more likely to buy that new model of Car by doing mail or sending SMS(depending on them). So in this way, the Car company can increase their chance of profit by using different model of Machine Learning. Implementing different model of classification on same dataset gives us the fair enough idea of what need to be change and getting that model which gives us most accuracy. In this project, we will be using dataset composed of columns like : Age Estimated Salary Purchased (since it's a classification,so it will be 0 and 1(buyed) At last, we will apply Model Selection technique such as "K-Fold Cross Validation" and "Grid Search" to reduce overfitting and to get best tuning hyper-parameters for our model!
