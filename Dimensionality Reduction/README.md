In this project, we have a dataset of various wines with their composition and we have customer segmentation that which type of wine is liked by what kind of customer and cluster them in 3 groups.Now since we have various composition of beer( independent variables), therefore we want to reduce it's dimensionality by "PCA", "LDA", "Kernel PCA" techniques such that we will only left with 2 dimension and then plotting the 3 clusters.At last, we will compare all these models and see which one will give highest accuracy. Now whenever in future a new wine arrives, the shopkeeper can serve it's customer better on their previous preferences (based on composition).In this way, shopkeeper can increase it's profit!
